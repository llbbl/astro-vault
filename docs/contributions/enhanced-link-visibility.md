# Enhancement: Improved Link Visibility in Article Content

## Problem

Links in article content were not visually prominent enough, making it difficult for readers to distinguish them from regular text at a glance. The previous styling used:
- Underline in border color (subtle, low contrast)
- Regular font weight
- Minimal visual distinction from body text

This made internal wiki-style links and external references harder to identify while reading.

## Solution

Enhanced link styling to make links more visually apparent and easier to identify:
1. **Always-visible underline** in primary color (not border color)
2. **Thicker underline** (2px default, 3px on hover)
3. **Medium font weight** (500) for better distinction
4. **Proper spacing** with `text-underline-offset` for readability
5. **Hover effect** that thickens underline and reduces opacity

## Changes

**File:** `src/pages/content/[...slug].astro`

### Updated Link Styles

Changed from:
```css
.article-content :global(a) {
  color: var(--primary);
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-color: var(--border);
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.article-content :global(a:hover) {
  text-decoration-color: var(--primary);
}
```

To:
```css
.article-content :global(a) {
  color: var(--primary);
  text-decoration: underline;
  text-decoration-color: var(--primary);
  text-decoration-thickness: 2px;
  text-underline-offset: 2px;
  font-weight: 500;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.article-content :global(a:hover) {
  text-decoration-thickness: 3px;
  opacity: 0.8;
}
```

## Benefits

- **Better Visibility**: Links are immediately recognizable in article content
- **Improved UX**: Readers can quickly scan for linked resources
- **Better Accessibility**: Higher visual contrast helps users with visual impairments
- **Professional Appearance**: Bold, confident link styling matches modern design standards
- **Clear Hover State**: Visual feedback makes interactive elements obvious
- **Theme Compatible**: Uses existing CSS variables, works across all themes

## Browser Compatibility

- `text-decoration-thickness`: Supported in all modern browsers
- `text-underline-offset`: Supported in all modern browsers
- No polyfills required

## Testing

1. Navigate to any documentation page with links
2. Verify links are visually distinct from body text
3. Hover over links to see the enhanced hover effect
4. Test across different themes (dark, light, ocean, etc.)
5. Verify readability and contrast in all theme modes
